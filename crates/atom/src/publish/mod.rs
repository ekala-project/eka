//! # Atom Publishing
//!
//! This module provides the types and logic necessary to efficiently publish atoms
//! to store implementations. The publishing system is designed to be safe, atomic,
//! and provide detailed feedback about the publishing process.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The publishing system is built around two main traits:
//!
//! - [`Builder`] - Constructs and validates publishers before publishing
//! - [`Publish`] - Handles the actual publishing of atoms to stores
//!
//! ## Publishing Process
//!
//! 1. **Validation** - All atoms in the workspace are validated for consistency
//! 2. **Deduplication** - Duplicate atoms are detected and skipped
//! 3. **Publishing** - Valid atoms are published to the target store
//! 4. **Reporting** - Detailed statistics and results are provided
//!
//! ## Key Types
//!
//! - [`Record`] - Contains the result of publishing a single atom
//! - [`Stats`] - Aggregated statistics for a publishing operation
//! - [`PublishOutcome`] - Result type for individual atom publishing attempts
//! - [`Content`] - Backend-specific content information
//!
//! ## Backends
//!
//! The architecture is designed to support multiple backends.
//! - **Git** - Publishes atoms as Git objects in repositories (when `git` feature is enabled)
//!
//! ## Safety Features
//!
//! - **Atomic operations** - Failed publishes don't leave partial state
//! - **Duplicate detection** - Prevents accidental overwrites
//! - **Comprehensive validation** - Ensures atom consistency before publishing
//! - **Detailed error reporting** - Clear feedback on what succeeded or failed
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use std::path::PathBuf;
//!
//! use atom::publish::git::GitPublisher;
//! use atom::publish::{Builder, Publish, Stats};
//! use atom::store::QueryVersion;
//! use atom::store::git::Root;
//!
//! let repo = gix::open(".")?;
//! // Create a publisher for a Git repository
//! let progress_span = tracing::info_span!("test");
//! let publisher = GitPublisher::new(&repo, "origin", "main", &progress_span)?;
//!
//! // Build and validate the publisher
//! let (valid_atoms, publisher) = publisher.build()?;
//!
//! // query upstream store for remote atom refs to compare against
//! let remote = publisher.remote();
//! let remote_atoms = remote.remote_atoms(None);
//!
//! // Publish all atoms
//! let results = publisher.publish(vec![PathBuf::from("/path/to/atom")], remote_atoms);
//!
//! // Check results
//! let stats = Stats::default();
//! for result in results {
//!     match result {
//!         Ok(outcome) => todo!(), // e.g. log `outcome`
//!         Err(e) => println!("Failed: {:?}", e),
//!     }
//! }
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
